This project, supported by the Nevada Department of Wildlife and Nevada Waterfowl Association, uses light-level geolocators to understand the annual migratory pathways of waterfowl in the Pacific flyway, and to assess the timing and location of individual breeding activities.   

This work is part of a larger effort to monitor wood duck population dynamics and movements in and around Fallon, NV (Fallon Wood Duck Project).
