## Crown-of-Thorns Starfish project

Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (C.O.T.S.) is a native predator of coral. On occasion, C.O.T.S. populations "explode", and these outbreaks represent one of the major recognized threats to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The A.P.E. lab is collaborating with researchers at James Cook University in Queensland (Sam Matthews), University of Adelaide (Damien Fordham), and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Camille Mellin) to better understand the drivers of C.O.T.S. population explosions and potentially develop strategies for how to reduce this threat to the Great Barrier Reef.
