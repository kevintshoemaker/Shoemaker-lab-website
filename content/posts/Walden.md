Margarete is a Ph.D. student who joined the APE lab and the EECB program in Fall 2016. Her research interests include population ecology, herpetology, conservation biology, terrestrial vertebrate physiology, and species' responses to climate change. She completed her M.S. with [Dr. Nancy Karraker](http://karraker.weebly.com/) on the timing of hibernation in Eastern Box Turtles. Margarete's research in the A.P.E. lab centers around understanding the environmental and climatic niche breadth of the Mojave Desert Tortoise (*Gopherus agassizii*). Margarete works closely with the Hunter lab at Georgia Southern University, which is performing similar research on the Gopher Tortoise (*Gopherus polyphemus*). Margarete is anticipating to complete her dissertation in Spring 2022.
