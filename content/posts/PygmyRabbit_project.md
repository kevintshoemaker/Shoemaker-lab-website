The A.P.E. lab is part of a larger team at UNR investigating the population genetics and demography of the pygmy rabbit (*Brachylagus idahoensis*) in the Great Basin.

To stay up to date on the pygmy rabbit project, led by APE lab PhD student Miranda Crowell, check out her [website](http://mirandamaurine.weebly.com/pygmy-rabbit-project.html)
