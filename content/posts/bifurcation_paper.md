As part of our field research, members of the A.P.E. lab occasionally stumble on a novel observation worthy of a published 'natural history note'. Here, we note the observation of tail bifurcation in the western skink, *Plestiodon skiltonianus*:

This is the first publication for UNR undergraduate Chasey Danser (pictured below doing field research)- congratulations Chasey!!
