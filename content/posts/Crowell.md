Miranda is a new PhD student who joined the Shoemaker and Matocq labs in April 2016. She is coming to University of Nevada, Reno from Washington State University in Pullman, WA where she completed her M.S. with Dr. Lisa Shipley investigating pygmy rabbits' foraging ecology. Here, at UNR, Miranda will be researching pygmy rabbit distribution across Nevada and southeastern Oregon, focusing on demography, genetic connectivity, and key landscape characteristics that pygmy rabbits require.
