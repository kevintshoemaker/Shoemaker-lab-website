Dr. Shoemaker's PhD dissertation focused on the conservation of bog turtles (*Glyptemys muhlenbergii*) in New York and Massachusetts. Building upon an existing capture-recapture dataset, he estimated population vital rates and abundance of these turtles in small wetlands in eastern New York (Dutchess County) and assessed for evidence of dispersal within a complex of multiple neighboring wetlands. His work also used microsatellite genotypes to further assess gene flow within these wetland complexes.

More recently, Dr. Shoemaker helped to mentor Suzanne Macey (PhD student, Fordham University), who continued to collect data from the same wetland complexes, performed nesting surveys, and analyzed the genetics data to assess parentage and patterns of nest site fidelity.
