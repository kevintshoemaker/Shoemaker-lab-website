## Danielle C Miles

Danielle is a PhD student in her fourth year as part of the A.P.E. lab. I am working on measuring the broad impacts of pinyon and juniper tree removal in sagebrush ecosystems on bat, bird, reptile, small mammal and insect populations. Besides this ecological study, I am interested in exploring anthropogenic effects on the environment such as climate change and deforestation with specific emphasis on the implications for amphibians.
