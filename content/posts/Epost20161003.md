![Elizabeth Hunter](/img/EAHwithrabbit2.jpg)

I was a postdoctoral researcher in the A.P.E. lab from 2016-2018 where I worked on several population modeling projects including: predicting plague outbreaks in black-tailed prairie dogs, using abundance data to predict the effects of competition on songbird responses to climate change, and simulation modeling to inform restoration of giant tortoise populations in the Galapagos Islands. I am now an Assistant Professor of Landscape Ecology at Georgia Southern University.
