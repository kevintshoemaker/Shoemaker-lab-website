## Our mission
Our expertise is in population biology, simulation modeling and statistics, and our passion is wildlife conservation. We combine our expertise and passion in creative ways. For example, we have

- Used Bayesian statistics and simulation modeling to develop conservation priorities for the bog turtle (*Glyptemys muhlenbergii*)
- Assessed the success of a long-term effort to reintroduce tortoises to Espanola island in Galapagos.

## Who we are
The A.P.E. lab currently includes Kevin Shoemaker (asst. prof.), Elizabeth Hunter (postdoc), and doctoral students Danielle Miles, Margarete Walden and Miranda Crowell.
