# Biography

Kevin Shoemaker is a wildlife population ecologist in the department of Natural Resources & Environmental Science at the University of Nevada, Reno.  Broadly, his research couples ecological data (e.g., census records, mark-recapture data, remote sensing data) with simulation models, statistics and machine learning to support wildlife conservation and management. Current projects include assessing the biodiversity impacts of pinyon and juniper removal in the Great Basin, planning the reintroduction of giant tortoises to Pinta island in Galapagos, forecasting the effects of predation, harvest, and climate change on the northern snake-necked turtle in Australia, and developing quantitative approaches to forecast the impact of climate change on species distribution and abundance.
