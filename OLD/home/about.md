# Biography

Kevin Shoemaker is the director of the Applied Population Ecology lab at the department of Natural Resources & Environmental Science at the University of Nevada, Reno. Broadly, his research couples ecological data (e.g., census records, mark-recapture data, remote sensing data) with simulation models, statistics and machine learning to support wildlife conservation and management. Current projects include:

- Measuring the biodiversity impacts of pinyon and juniper removal in the Great Basin (focus on bats, reptiles and insects)
- Assessing the regional population structure and conservation status of pygmy rabbits (*Brachylagus idahoensis*) in Nevada
- Planning the reintroduction of giant tortoises to Pinta island in Galapagos
- Forecasting the effects of predation, harvest, and climate change on the northern snake-necked turtle in Australia
- Developing quantitative approaches to forecast the impact of climate change on species distribution and abundance.
