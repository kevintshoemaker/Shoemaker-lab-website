As part of my dissertation work at SUNY-ESF, I developed a new method for estimating yearling recruitment from mark-recapture data in cases where age information is available (for many turtles, age can be estimated on the basis of annuli -- rings on the scutes of the plastron and/or carapace). More recently, I have been working with colleagues to use a nationwide bird banding database (MAPS: Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship) to parameterize metapopulation models for a broad spectrum of North American avifauna. Also, I am working with colleagues at the University of Rhode Island to use a 100-year mark recapture data set on eastern box turtles (*Terrapene c. carolina*) to inform management practices and conservation strategies for this species.
