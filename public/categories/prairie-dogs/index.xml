      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February 2015, experts on prairie dog and plague ecology convened and identified a need for a broad synthesis of existing data to evaluate the factors driving plague die-offs in black-tailed prairie dog (BTPD) colonies. Several published studies have already shown that temperature, precipitation and topography can affect the probability of a die-off event. However, a broader synthesis of datasets from across the BTPD range may enable more accurate prediction of when and where die-offs will occur. The APE lab is leading a large collaborative project to create predictive models of BTPD colony die-offs caused by the plague bacterium.  We have acquired colony history data from across the BTPD range and are working on using machine learning techniques to create a model of plague outbreaks that can help managers determine how best to target their anti-plague management activities (such as &amp;ldquo;dusting&amp;rdquo; for fleas and vaccine administration).  This model will also help us better understand the selection pressures that could lead to &lt;a href=&#34;http://naes.unr.edu/shoemaker/lab/posts/PlagueModeling_project/&#34;&gt;genetic resistance to plague&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
